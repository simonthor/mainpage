# Mainpage version 1.0 [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/simonthor/mainpage/blob/master/LICENSE)
A minimalist Firefox extension for redirecting to the front page of a website. 
This version of mainpage is planned to be uploaded to the [Mozilla add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org).
All the files (no more, no less) for the actual firefox extension is in the [mainpage-1.0](/mainpage-1.0.zip) zip-folder.

## Tutorial
Once installed, the mainpage icon will appear in the toolbar. Press it, and you will be redirected to your current tab's website's front page.
It's as simple as that!

Note: This extension will redirect to the subdomain's front page, not to the entire website's front page. 
**This is an intentional feature, not a bug.**
Although another feature for redirecting to the entire domain's front page might be added in future versions.
